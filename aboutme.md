### My story
As the youngest child, I grew playing video games that were older than me thanks to hand-me-downs and my dads utter refusal to part ways with old tech. (Sonic Adventure 2 on the Dreamcast is *peak*)

Eventually I saved up enough lawn mowing cash to build my first PC so I could move past sharing seats with my best-friend and playing his iMac in turns. Him and I *loved* Minecraft, and we quickly found a boundless passion in modding it and figuring out how to play LAN across the street (seeing the words "port-forwarding" in a class 12 years later gave me major whiplash!)

My decision to pursue Computer Engineering was the culmination of many of these little interactions with tech. Now my habits of keeping up with "The Best GPUs for X" articles and finding killer deals for RAM on PCPartPicker have become habits of reading IEEE and ACM publications and scouring DigiKey for the correct PCIe connector out of 100,000 possible versions. That little version of me who was blown away when he first saw redstone would be proud.

### My goal
I love digital media and art - be it video games, animation, CGI, or Daft Punk - and I've *always* wanted to play a part in creating it. However, somewhere along the line I realized I might be better off giving tools to artists rather than becoming one myself. 

We know that technology shaped Pixar, or perhaps Pixar shaped technology, and that GPUs began with gaming, but now dominate the AI industry; I believe these are examples of a bigger trend that human creativity and technology work hand-in-hand.

Because I love creative works *and* technology, I'd love to help make the "shovels" necessary for this movement. So, some of my curiosities are in GPU architecture and graphics programming as well as consumer electronics like hobbyist mechanical keyboards. 

Above all I love learning, and on this site I'll try to share what I learn, thanks for reading!
